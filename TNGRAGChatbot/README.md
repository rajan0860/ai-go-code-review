TNG Script Explorer Chatbot
Overview
Star Trek: The Next Generation spans seven seasons filled with philosophical debates, technical challenges, and memorable dialogue. This project explores a simple idea:
What if you could ask questions about TNG and get answers based on real episode scripts—while also checking facts and doing simple calculations when needed?
The TNG Script Explorer Chatbot is an experimental assistant that combines script search, web lookup, and basic reasoning tools to give clearer, more reliable answers.

The Problem
Fans and researchers often face several challenges when exploring Star Trek: The Next Generation:
* Scripts and transcripts are spread across many websites
* Finding specific moments or quotes can be time-consuming
* Regular chatbots may guess or invent answers
* Some questions require extra context, like episode air dates, counts, or comparisons
In short, no single tool provides grounded answers, background context, and basic reasoning together.

What This Project Solves

TNGRAGChatbot combines multiple tools to provide reliable answers:

Script Search (RAG) – Finds relevant TNG scenes and dialogue to ground responses.

Web Search – Retrieves factual information from public sources when needed (e.g., episode air dates, production info).

Math & Logic Helper – Handles calculations, comparisons, and counts accurately.

Together, these capabilities let users ask anything from “What did Picard say about the Prime Directive?” to “How many episodes feature Data learning about humor?”, and get precise, grounded answers.

Who It’s For

* Star Trek fans who want a conversational companion
* Writers studying dialogue or storytelling
* People exploring ethics, leadership, and technology in TNG
* Anyone curious about episode details, quotes, or numeric facts


How It Works

The chatbot uses a combination of helpful tools working together:
Script Search (RAG)
When you ask a question about TNG, the chatbot first searches through the episode transcripts to find relevant scenes or dialogue. It then builds its response using those exact passages, instead of guessing.
Web Search
For questions that go beyond the scripts—such as episode air dates, production details, or historical context—the chatbot can briefly look up reliable public information to support the answer.

Math & Logic Helper
Some questions involve counting episodes, comparing seasons, or doing simple calculations. A built-in math helper ensures these answers are accurate instead of estimated.
Together, these tools help the chatbot think before it speaks.

What You Can Do With It
* Ask questions about episodes or characters
* Explore themes like leadership, ethics, and diplomacy
* Recall dialogue grounded in the scripts
* Get summaries supported by real scenes
* Ask questions that combine story details with facts or numbers
All without needing any technical knowledge.

Data Sources
* Fan-created transcripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation
* Publicly available web sources for factual context
All script content is used locally for personal and educational purposes.

Limitations
* The chatbot only knows what it can find in the transcripts or public sources
* It does not replace official reference materials
* Other Star Trek series are not included yet

Future Vision
Possible future improvements include:
* Adding more Star Trek series
* Creating character-specific personalities
* Improving conversational flow
* Making the chatbot feel more like the Enterprise computer
* Expanding research and reasoning abilities

Purpose
This project is a learning and exploration experiment designed to show how combining multiple tools—script search, web lookup, and basic reasoning—can make complex fictional worlds easier to explore in a natural, conversational way.
